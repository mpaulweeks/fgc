    <p> FightingGame.Community was always a passion project. What originally started as a way for me and my friends to track our stats exploded into a public database that tracked 24k players, purely by word-of-mouth. </p>

    <p> Unfortunately, for many reasons, I will be shutting down the SFV stats/leaderboard. <br/>
    The site stopped pulling new data June 29, and I have since removed the majority of the users. <br/>
    What currently remains is the matchup data, leaderboard, and stats for the top 500 players. </p>

    <p> Luckily, since this site was launched, alternatives have sprung up, such as <a href="http://v-league.pro/">v-league.pro</a> <br/>
    If you would like me to mention your site/app here, just <a href="/about"> contact me</a>. </p>

    <p> For those interested, I have made this site's source code available on <a href="https://github.com/mpaulweeks/fgc">my personal github</a>. </p>

    <p> Also, just because this particular site is shutting down doesn't mean I'm done working! <br/>
    You can check out all of my current FGC-related projects <a href="http://fgc.mpaulweeks.com/">here</a>.</p>

    <p> Special thanks go out to UltraDavid, Edward "RLBS" Hung, David Cosgrove, and MikeZ. </p>

    <p> Most of all, big big thanks to everyone who ever emailed or tweeted me. <br/>
    Whether it was a bug, complaint, idea, or just saying hi, I appreciated every single message. <br/>
    It was your feedback and encouragement that kept the site running. I will forever cherish the experience &#60;3 </p>

    <br/>
    <p class="text-center"> So long, and thanks for all the fish!<br/>
